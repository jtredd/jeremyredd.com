# Django Gunicorn Nginx
Base image for Django With PostgreSQL and Redis

This is my attempt at automating my old pipeline. I wanted to save this somewhere before I flatten,
and start a better one.

Edit the `*.env` files to edit configuration for your staging environment.


###::FIXME
op requirements like domainname portability could be done differently
i.e. hardcode 'example.com' or set with env variable. 'localhost' is sort of
pointless because this workflow requires a valid domainname.

###::DONTFIX
use this as a good example for E2E workflow using 3rd party validation for certificates 
without ðŸ’° or BC for PFS that will work so long as web clients policy for SSL3 remain
the same with 2016 as they should so long as SNI is not the reason.


mv example.docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml
# SET SECURITY, ENVIRONMENT OR
# SOURCE `envars`
. envars
# AND EXECUTE THE NECESSARY FUNCTIONS
set_env
set_sec
docker-compose build --force-rm
docker-compose up -d
# INIT DATABSE IF NECESSARY
init_database
```

### Django Migrations  

And then learn Django, but not necessarily in that order :)

```
docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate
docker-compose run web python manage.py makemigrations polls
docker-compose run web python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001
```
